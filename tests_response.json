Implement network-based and/or host-based intrusion detection or prevention tools.\n2. Maintain current intrusion detection or prevention signatures.\n3. Monitor inbound and outbound communications for unusual or unauthorized activities.\n4. Send individual intrusion detection logs to a central logging facility where correlation and\nanalysis will be accomplished as a system wide intrusion detection effort.\n5.

In other words, virtual machine users cannot\naccess host files, firmware, etc.\n2. Maintain audit logs for all virtual machines and hosts and store the logs outside the hosts’\nvirtual environment.\n3. Virtual Machines that are Internet facing (web servers, portal servers, etc.) shall be\nphysically separate from Virtual Machines (VMs) that process CJI internally or be\nseparated by a virtual firewall.\n4. Drivers that serve critical functions shall be stored within the specific VM they service. In\nother words, do not store these drivers within the hypervisor, or host operating system, for\nsharing. Each VM is to be treated as an independent system – secured as independently as\npossible.\nThe following additional technical security controls shall be applied in virtual environments where\nCJI is comingled with non-CJI:\n1. Encrypt CJI when stored in a virtualized environment where CJI is comingled with nonCJI or \nsegregate and store unencrypted CJI within its own secure VM.\n2. Encrypt network traffic within the virtual environment.\nThe following are additional technical security control best practices and should be implemented\nwherever feasible:\n1. Implement IDS and/or IPS monitoring within the virtual environment.\n2. Virtually or physically firewall each VM within the virtual environment to ensure that only\nallowed protocols will transact.\n3.

They are passive in nature, listening and \nmonitoring network traffic. There are mainly two types of IDS; network-based IDS (NIDS) and \nhost-based IDS (HIDS). Intrusion prevention systems are an IDS with the capability to respond to \ndetected intrusions. They are normally deployed at the perimeter of a network, scanning traffic. \nLike detection systems, protection systems compare scanned traffic to defined normal parameters \nbut unlike detection systems are able to take some type of immediate action to mitigate, or prevent, an event.\nAgencies shall:\n1. Implement network-based and/or host-based intrusion detection or prevention tools.\n2. Maintain current intrusion detection or prevention signatures.\n3. Monitor inbound and outbound communications for unusual or unauthorized activities.\n4. Send individual intrusion detection logs to a central logging facility where correlation and\nanalysis will be accomplished as a system wide intrusion detection effort.\n5. Review intrusion detection or prevention logs weekly or implement automated event\nnotification.\n6. Employ automated tools to support near-real-time analysis of events in support of detecting\nsystem-level attacks.",

When agencies implement encryption on CJI at rest, the passphrase used to unlock the\ncipher shall meet the following requirements:\na. Be at least 10 characters\nb. Not be a dictionary word.\nc. Include at least one (1) upper case letter, one (1) lower case letter, one (1) number,\nand one (1) special character.\nd. Be changed when previously authorized personnel no longer require access.\n2. Multiple files maintained in the same unencrypted folder shall have separate and distinct\npassphrases. A single passphrase may be used to encrypt an entire folder or disk containing\nmultiple files. All audit requirements found in Section 5.4.1 Auditable Events and Content\n(Information Systems) shall be applied.\nNOTE: Commonly available encryption tools often use a key to unlock the cipher to allow\ndata access; this key is called a passphrase. While similar to a password, a passphrase is\nnot used for user authentication. Additionally, the passphrase contains stringent character\nrequirements making it more secure and thus providing a higher level of confidence that\nthe passphrase will not be compromised.",

Virtualized environments are authorized for\ncriminal justice and noncriminal justice activities. In addition to the security controls described in\nthe Policy, the following additional controls shall be implemented in a virtual environment:\n1. Isolate the host from the virtual machine. In other words, virtual machine users cannot\naccess host files, firmware, etc.\n2. Maintain audit logs for all virtual machines and hosts and store the logs outside the hosts’\nvirtual environment.\n3. Virtual Machines that are Internet facing (web servers, portal servers, etc.) shall be\nphysically separate from Virtual Machines (VMs) that process CJI internally or be\nseparated by a virtual firewall.\n4. Drivers that serve critical functions shall be stored within the specific VM they service. In\nother words, do not store these drivers within the hypervisor, or host operating system, for\nsharing. Each VM is to be treated as an independent system – secured as independently as\npossible.\nThe following additional technical security controls shall be applied in virtual environments where\nCJI is comingled with non-CJI:\n1. Encrypt CJI when stored in a virtualized environment where CJI is comingled with nonCJI or \nsegregate and store unencrypted CJI within its own secure VM.\n2. Encrypt network traffic within the virtual environment.\nThe following are additional technical security control best practices and should be implemented\nwherever feasible:\n1. Implement IDS and/or IPS monitoring within the virtual environment.\n2. Virtually or physically firewall each VM within the virtual environment to ensure that only\nallowed protocols will transact.\n3.

Encrypt CJI when stored in a virtualized environment where CJI is comingled with nonCJI or \nsegregate and store unencrypted CJI within its own secure VM.\n2.

                  "description": "When setting up access controls, agencies shall use one or more of the following mechanisms:\n1. Access Control Lists (ACLs). ACLs are a register of users (including groups, machines,\nprocesses) who have been given permission to use a particular object (system resource)\nand the types of access they have been permitted.\n2. Resource Restrictions. Access to specific functions is restricted by never allowing users\nto request information, functions, or other resources for which they do not have access.\nThree major types of resource restrictions are: menus, database views, and network\ndevices.\n3. Encryption. Encrypted information can only be decrypted, and therefore read, by those\npossessing the appropriate cryptographic key. While encryption can provide strong access\ncontrol, it is accompanied by the need for strong key management. Follow the guidance in\nSection 5.10.1.2 for encryption requirements if encryption of stored information is\nemployed as an access enforcement mechanism.\n4. Application Level. In addition to controlling access at the information system level, access\nenforcement mechanisms are employed at the application level to provide increased\ninformation security for the agency.",

AA shall not be required for users requesting access to CJI from within the perimeter\nof a physically secure location (Section 5.9), when the technical security controls have been met\n(Sections 5.5 and 5.10), or when the user has no ability to conduct transactional activities on state\nand national repositories, applications, or services (i.e. indirect access). Conversely, if the\ntechnical security controls have not been met, AA shall be required even if the request for CJI\noriginates from within a physically secure location. Section 5.6.2.2.2 provides agencies with a\ndecision tree to help guide AA decisions. The CSO will make the final determination of whether\naccess is considered indirect.\nThe intent of AA is to meet the standards of two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication\nemploys the use of two of the following three factors of authentication: something you know (e.g.\npassword), something you have (e.g. hard token), something you are (e.g. biometric).

Verifiers shall use approved encryption and an authenticated protected channel when\nrequesting passwords to protect against eavesdropping and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)\nattacks.\n9. Verifiers shall store passwords in a manner that is resistant to offline attacks by salting and\nhashing the password using a one-way key derivation function when stored.\na. The salt shall be at least 32 bits in length.\nb. The salt shall be chosen arbitrarily so as to minimize salt value collisions among stored\nhashes.\nNote: Key derivation functions take a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs then\ngenerate a password hash. Their purpose is to make each password guessing trial by an\nattacker who has obtained a password hash file expensive and therefore the cost of a\nguessing attack high or prohibitive.\n10. For each subscriber, Verifiers shall protect stored salt and resulting hash values using a\npassword or PIN.",

However, the Interface Agency may ask for a review by the CSO in\nextenuating circumstances where the severity of the offense and the time that has\npassed would support a possible variance.\nb. Applicants with a record of misdemeanor offense(s) may be granted access if the\nCSO, or his or her designee, determines the nature or severity of the misdemeanor\noffense(s) do not warrant disqualification. The Interface Agency may request the\nCSO review a denial of access determination. This same procedure applies if the\nperson is found to be a fugitive or has an arrest history without conviction.\nc. If a record of any kind is found on a contractor, the CGA shall be formally notified\nand system access shall be delayed pending review of the criminal history record\ninformation. The CGA shall in turn notify the contractor’s security officer.\n4. If the person appears to be a fugitive or has an arrest history without conviction, the CSO\nor his/her designee shall review the matter to determine if access to CJI is appropriate.\n5. If the person already has access to CJI and is subsequently arrested and or convicted,\ncontinued access to CJI shall be determined by the CSO. This does not implicitly grant\nhiring/firing authority with the CSA, only the authority to grant access to CJI. For offenses\nother than felonies, the CSO has the latitude to delegate continued access determinations\nto his or her designee.\n6. If the CSO or his/her designee determines that access to CJI by the person would not be in\nthe public interest, access shall be denied and the person's appointing authority shall be\nnotified in writing of the access denial.\n7. The granting agency shall maintain a list of personnel who have been authorized unescorted\naccess to unencrypted CJI and shall, upon request, provide a current copy of the access list\nto the CSO.\nIt is recommended individual background re-investigations be conducted every five years unless\nRap Back is implemented.",
